"""
This library gives two main interface functions right now:
  intraday_volatility_of_day ~ gives an indicator of how frothy trading within a day
    was. This measure is designed to be used to compare days to eachother.
  interday_volatility_of_period ~ gives an indicator of how frothy trading over a
    period of many days is. This could be used to compare months, or feel out what
    price swings in the "current regime" might be like.

Notes on volatility:

We have several different data sources we can calculate volatility of
  i) Our Core FV
  ii) Trade series
  iii) Middle prices from orderbooks

These functions use core fv to start because that is simplest, but we should move to
using the trade series or middle prices sometime soon. There are lots of different
choices for which type of volatility we look at: the period we look back, the sample
frequency, whether to annualize, whether to use returns or log returns, and which
metric to  use. Common metrics are stddev, variance, average absolute return.

- http://www.investopedia.com/university/optionvolatility/volatility2.asp?no_header_alt=true
- http://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/2589/how-to-calculate-historical-intraday-volatility

TODO:
- Test methods against some known dataset.
- Move to looking at our saved trade history instead of core fv.
- Doublecheck that the way we annualize daily returns is valid.
