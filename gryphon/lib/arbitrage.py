Arbitrage library. Takes in orderbooks and gives back information about arbitrage
opportunities present in them.

The current orderbook format is a dictionary of bid and ask exchange orders. This could
be changed as part of a larger refactor to bring all our orderbook representations to a
single standard.

    Calculates the volume by which buy_ob's asks cut into sell_ob's bids, and the
    profit that could be gleaned if one could take the arbitrage. By default will not
    return a cross if it is not profitable to take advantage of given the fee brackets
    on the two pairs. This can be turned off by setting the argument ignore_unprofitable

    Returns a Cross object containing the total volume of the overlap, the expected
    revenue and expected fees if one were to take the full opportunity. By default

    Notes:
      - The orderbook arguments are named for the action you take, not the type of order
        you are looking at. If you want to buy on ob1 and sell on ob2, you look at the
        asks on ob1 (buy_ob) and the bids on ob2 (sell_ob).
      - This supports considering orderbooks with different price currencies, since
        that is a common operation. However, if you wish to use this for price
        currencies with high hourly or even minute-ly volatility (like BTC, ETH or any
        other cryptocurrency), the speed at which exchange rates are updated in the
        builtin exchange rate service--OpenExchangeRates--may not be fast enough. It's
        strongly recommended that users do their own research on this.
      - It's important that the market order fees for the exchanges you use have be
        accurately configured.
      - In this usage 'volume' refers to the area of the overlap, which is one-half the
        total volume that would be required in orders to take the opportunity, since
        there are two exchanges.
