"""
This script modifies the database object and ledger for an exchange to bring both in
line with the exchange API's reported balance for this account.

It does this by calculating forcing exchange_account.balance to equal ledger_balance,
and then adding arbitrary deposit or withdrawal transactions to the ledger to make
the ledger match what the exchange API reports.

This is NOT intended to be used except on test databases or in extraordinary
circumstances. Adding arbitrary adjustments to the ledger can cause serious problems for
your business down the line.

This script does not wipe the trade or transaction history.

TODO: We need better language for the 'balance' field on the ExchangeData/Exchange
account database object. It's really just a cache.
