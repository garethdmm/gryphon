"""
`gryphon-exec strategy` takes configration parameters both from the command line and
from a .conf file. This library is concerned with standardizing the format of the
config dictionary that is passed into the harness, and handling the rules for combining
configuration settings from both sources.

Just a few functions that make our configuration handling cleaner.

The rule is: 
  1) From any source, if something isn't specified explicitly, it is
      left out of the dictionary, or put as None, and any other value from any
      source will override it.
  2) Always specify defaults in code.
  3) At no point is there a any guarantee a setting is in the configuration object.

    Turns a list of unknown arguments from the controller into a dictionary. This is
    necessary because the framework doesn't know what argument a strategy might
    require.

    This ONLY supports named arguments, and only supports the syntax '--name name', not
    --name=name.

    There are likely more graceful ways to do this, such as having Strategies know which
    of their properties are configurable and allowing them to register extra arguments,
    but this will do for now.

      - don't print messages from argparse here, just throw an exception or something.
      - the hackery here to support boolean flags (the nargs/const condition) means that
        if you don't give an value for an argument that should have one, no error is
        thrown, and that value is set to 'True'. In most cases this should be caught
