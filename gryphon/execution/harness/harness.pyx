"""
The Harness is the execution context we provide to Strategies for them to interact with
the outside world. This allows us to provide a level of robustness and simplicity of
interface that would be strictly impossible if strategies were to interact directly with
exchanges themselves.

Adding this level of abstraction is useful for other purposes, too. Sometimes, you'll
want your strategies to run in a context that isn't the real world, such as during
backtesting. For this, you can write another harness (so long as it conforms to the same
interface), and reimplement the interface functions in a different way.
